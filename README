This is my take on a so called "Line editor"
Its a crude and simple line editor.

TODO:
- Create a function to retrieve a line from file (DONE) It's called: GET_LINE(char filename[], long focus, char **line)
- Create edit mode to actually make edits to the file
- Create write mode to write changes. Might remove writemode.c and implement it within the edit mode file.
