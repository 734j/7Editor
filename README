This is my take on a so called "Line editor"
Its a crude and simple line editor.

WARNING: Do not use this program on any files that you dont want to risk damaging, deleting or overwriting. I can not gaurantee that this program will function as expected.

TODO:
- Create a function to retrieve a line from file (DONE) It's called: GET_LINE(char filename[], long focus, char **line)
- Create edit mode to actually make edits to the file (DONE)
- Find and fix bugs. Fixed one bug in write_line() function. (btw this was written with 7ed!!!)
- Create functionality to actually add new lines. You cant actually add a line on the end of the file. You also cant just add a line and move everything under it one line down. I will get to fixing that though.
