This is my take on a so called "Line editor"
Its a crude and simple line editor.

TODO:
- Create a function to retrieve a line from file (DONE) It's called: GET_LINE(char filename[], long focus, char **line)
- Create edit mode to actually make edits to the file (DONE)
- Find and fix bugs
- Fix weird quirks that i did not think about
- clean up code
