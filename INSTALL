To compile this program just type 'make release' or 'make'

And then to install it you will have to 'make install' as root.

- You may change the installation directory in the Makefile if you wish to,
just change the INSTALL_DIRECTORY variable to wherever you want to install it.

- The program will be compiled with the -static flag by default but you may remove it if you wish,
just change the CFLAGS variable.

If you encounter problems compiling you may have to do changes in the source code.
I encountered some problems compiling on MacOS so i had to modify alot of format specifiers.
I have not been able to compile with clang because i got some unclear errors. I think it has to do with me using 'goto' and maybe something to do with my 'switch' statements but fixing this is not a priority.
