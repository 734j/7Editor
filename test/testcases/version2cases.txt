Not gonna make any test cases. The plan right now is to go through ALL
functionality with an exploratory type of testing. 

General things to test:
- Entry to the program -v and -i 
- Most basic usage of COMMANDS
- Use commands with + and numbers. 
- See how the program handles permissions
- If theres a way to test this that isnt outlined in the points then i will do
  that too obviously
- Perform tests on both 7ed-TESTING binary as well as release (7ed) binary.
