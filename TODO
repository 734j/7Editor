TODO list. This is mostly so i can plan more granularly and remember small stuff i was working on last time and what i should prioritise first. 
This is not my overall big planning board. (1 highest prio, 10 lowest)  

1 - All L functionality is done. Now i will have to test it and and fix any issues that come up.
1 - Start implementing N.
2 - Not really a TODO point but more of an observation and a realisation i have made. I could have just used regex to do the validation of my commands. How about that... Well im too far in (sunk cost fallacy or whatever its called).
