TODO list. This is mostly so i can plan more granularly and remember small stuff i was working on last time and what i should prioritise first. 
This is not my overall big planning board. (1 highest prio, 10 lowest)  

1 - Implement 'd' validation
1 - Test 'd' validation
2 - Implement 'x' validation
2 - Test 'x' validation
2 - improve the length check (i have NO idea how it actually works because im slow stupid!)
3 - Have a big long think about how the strings will be processed and translate in to actually doing things in the program.
