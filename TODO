TODO list. This is mostly so i can plan more granularly and remember small stuff i was working on last time and what i should prioritise first. 
This is not my overall big planning board. (1 highest prio, 10 lowest)  

1 - Make remove_line_contents more efficient. Maybe allow specifying amount of lines to add so we dont need to call the function too many times.
