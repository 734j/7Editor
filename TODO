TODO list. This is mostly so i can plan more granularly and remember small stuff i was working on last time and what i should prioritise first. 
This is not my overall big planning board. (1 highest prio, 10 lowest)  

1 - Start working on X
1 - Start working on D
2 - Re-write new_line and remove_line_contents for better performance. (They are very inefficient)
2 - All L and N functionality is done. Did some testing and made some fixes. I will keep this here for now in case i find anything more.
2 - Not really a TODO point but more of an observation and a realisation i have made. I could have just used regex to do the validation of my commands. How about that... Well im too far in (sunk cost fallacy or whatever its called).
