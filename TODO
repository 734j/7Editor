TODO list. This is mostly so i can plan more granularly and remember small stuff i was working on last time and what i should prioritise first. 
This is not my overall big planning board. (1 highest prio, 10 lowest)  

1 - test validate_check_p_m
1 - test validate_check_imm
1 - test validate_plus_continue
1 - testcases for the 3 above
2 - continue work on validate_imm_numbers
