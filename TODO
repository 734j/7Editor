TODO list. This is mostly so i can plan more granularly and remember small stuff i was working on last time and what i should prioritise first. 
This is not my overall big planning board. (1 highest prio, 10 lowest)  

1 - Remove testing code, add comments for future me.
1 - Perform full test of the whole program
1 - Re-write USAGE
2 - Re-write Makefile to make it easier
2 - Add some quality of life features
3 - Re-write new_line and remove_line_contents for better performance. (They are very inefficient)
4 - Not really a TODO point but more of an observation and a realisation i have made. I could have just used regex to do the validation of my commands. How about that... Well im too far in (sunk cost fallacy or whatever its called).
