TODO list. This is mostly so i can plan more granularly and remember small stuff i was working on last time and what i should prioritise first. 
This is not my overall big planning board. (1 highest prio, 10 lowest)  

1 - Write testcases for validate_L
1 - Perform some tests on validate_L
2 - Have a big long think about how validate_N should work
2 - implement validate_N
2 - Perform tests on validate_N
3 - Have a big long think about how the strings will be processed and translate in to actually doing things in the program.
